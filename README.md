# Data Science Portfolio by Jeff Weintraub

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects. If you're reading this today, this page is still a big work in progress.

## Sports Analytics

### NBA Contract Value

This project attempts to quantify the quality of management, coaching, and ownership in the NBA in terms of player performance per dollar spent (adjusted for factors such as injuries). Live version is [here](x). The code can be viewed [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/weintraubje/weintraubje.github.io/blob/main/NBA%20Contracts/NBA%20Contract%20Analytics.ipynb).
