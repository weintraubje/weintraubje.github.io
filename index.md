# Data Science Portfolio by Jeff Weintraub

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.

## Sports Analytics

### NBA Executive and Ownership Analysis

This project measures the quality of executives and owners in the NBA based off their ability to not only recognize and pay for talent, but also to construct a quality team of players who work well together. A live version of the final results can be found [here [WIP]](x). The code and underlying analysis can be found [here in nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/weintraubje/weintraubje.github.io/blob/main/NBA%20Contracts/NBA%20Contract%20Analytics.ipynb).
